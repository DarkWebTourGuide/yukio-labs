## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and systems that can analyze and understand visual data, such as images and videos. It involves the use of techniques such as image and video recognition, object detection, and image segmentation to enable machines to perceive and interpret the world in a way similar to humans.

Computer vision has a wide range of applications, including image and video recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical image analysis. It has also been used in fields such as retail, manufacturing, and agriculture to automate tasks and improve efficiency.

CV algorithms can be trained on large data sets of visual data and can be used to perform tasks such as object recognition, face detection, and image classification.
