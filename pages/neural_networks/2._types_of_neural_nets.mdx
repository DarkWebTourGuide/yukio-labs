## Types of Neural Networks
There are several types of neural networks, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Some common types of neural networks include:

1. **Feedforward neural networks:** These are the most common type of neural networks. They consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input data is processed through the network in a single pass, with the output being produced based on the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons.
2. **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs):** These are neural networks that are specifically designed for image and video recognition tasks. They are inspired by the structure of the human visual system and are designed to process input data in a way that is similar to the way the human visual system processes images. CNNs consist of multiple layers of neurons, with each layer processing the input data in a different way.
3. **Recurrent neural networks (RNNs):** These are neural networks that have loops in their structure, allowing them to process input data over time. They are well-suited to tasks that involve sequential data, such as natural language processing or speech recognition.
4. **Autoencoders:** These are neural networks that are used for unsupervised learning. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which are trained to reconstruct the input data from a lower-dimensional representation. Autoencoders are often used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.
5. **Generative adversarial networks (GANs):** These are neural networks that consist of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate synthetic data that is similar to the training data, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and synthetic data. GANs have been used for tasks such as image generation and style transfer.

These are just a few examples of the many types of neural networks that are available. The choice of neural network type will depend on the specific problem being addressed and the characteristics of the data.
