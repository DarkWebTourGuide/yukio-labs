# What are Neural Networks

Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, called "neurons," which are connected by weights and biases. The input data is processed through the network of neurons, and the output is produced based on the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons.

Neural networks are particularly well-suited to tasks that require the identification of patterns or relationships in large amounts of data. They can be trained using a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation, to adjust the weights and biases of the connections between the neurons in order to improve the accuracy of the output.
