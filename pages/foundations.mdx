# Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a complex and rapidly evolving field, and as such, it can be difficult to keep track of all the key concepts and definitions. In this section, we'll take a look at some of the most important terms you need to know if you're interested in AI.

## Foundations
One of the key concepts in AI is **machine learning**. This involves using algorithms and statistical models to allow computers to "learn" from data, rather than being explicitly programmed to perform a specific task. Machine learning algorithms are able to learn from data by adjusting their parameters based on the input they receive, allowing them to improve their performance over time.

Another important concept in AI is **deep learning**. This is a type of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the way the human brain works. These networks are able to learn and adapt to new situations by adjusting the connections between their virtual "neurons". Deep learning has led to significant advances in fields such as image and speech recognition, and is an active area of research in AI.

**Natural language processing (NLP)** is another important concept in AI. This involves using AI to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP has a wide range of applications, including the development of virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, and the analysis of large volumes of text data for insights and trends.

These are just a few of the key concepts and definitions you need to know if you're interested in AI. From machine learning and deep learning, to natural language processing, these concepts form the foundation of the field and are driving many of the exciting developments in AI today.

## Data + Algorithms
**Data** is the foundation of any AI system. Without data, an AI system has nothing to learn from and cannot make any decisions or predictions. Data is used in training artificial intelligence, which means feeding it a large amount of data and using that data to fine-tune the algorithms that power the AI system. The more data a system has, the more accurate and reliable its predictions and decisions will be.

**Algorithms**, on the other hand, are the set of instructions that tell the AI system what to do with the data it has been given. These algorithms can range from simple decision trees to complex neural networks, and they are responsible for making sense of the data and extracting meaningful insights from it.

In AI systems, data and algorithms work together to enable the system to learn and adapt to new situations. The data is used to train the algorithms, and the algorithms are used to make predictions and decisions based on the data. This process is known as machine learning, and it allows the AI system to continually improve and evolve over time as it is exposed to more data.

One example of the role of data and algorithms in an AI system is in the development of a self-driving car. The AI system in a self-driving car must be able to analyze data from various sensors, such as cameras and lidar, to make real-time decisions about the car's actions. This data is fed into algorithms that are trained to recognize objects, classify them, and predict how they will behave. The algorithms then use this information to make decisions about the car's movements, such as when to turn, when to stop, and when to accelerate.

Data and algorithms are integral to the functioning of AI systems. Data is used to train the algorithms, and the algorithms are used to make predictions and decisions based on the data. Together, data and algorithms enable AI systems to learn and adapt to new situations, making them increasingly useful and valuable in a wide range of applications.
