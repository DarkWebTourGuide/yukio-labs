# Overview
Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), also known as weak AI or narrow AI, is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. ANI systems are trained on a specific set of data and are designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

One of the key features of ANI systems is their ability to learn and adapt to new situations. ANI systems are able to learn from data and improve their performance over time, and they are able to adapt to new situations by adjusting their algorithms and models based on new data. This makes ANI systems particularly useful for tasks that involve complex data and require the ability to learn and adapt.

There are many examples of ANI systems that are being used in a wide range of applications, including image and video recognition, natural language processing, and financial analysis. Image and video recognition ANI systems are able to recognize and classify objects and scenes in images and videos, and they are used in a variety of applications, such as security systems and social media platforms. Natural language processing ANI systems are able to understand and process human language, and they are used in applications such as voice assistants and customer service chatbots. Financial analysis ANI systems are able to analyze financial data and make predictions and recommendations, and they are used in applications such as stock trading and fraud detection.

Despite the many benefits of ANI systems, they have some limitations compared to artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems. ANI systems are designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, and they are not able to perform tasks outside of their specific domain. In contrast, AGI systems are designed to be able to perform any intellectual task that a human can, and they have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work.
