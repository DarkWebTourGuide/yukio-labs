## What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the ability of machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves the use of techniques such as text and speech recognition, language translation, and text generation to enable machines to communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.

NLP has a wide range of applications, including language translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development. It has also been used in fields such as healthcare, finance, and customer service to process and analyze large amounts of text data.
